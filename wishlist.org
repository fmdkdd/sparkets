* Gameplay
** New weapons & items
*** Machine gun
	 Rapid-fire weapon but takes longer to kill ships. Go against the
	 one shot/one kill principle of the current gameplay. Could be used
	 for other bonuses like slowdown shots. The player launch burst of
	 tiny projectiles and the more the enemy get shot, the slower he
	 gets.

*** Portable black hole
	 Gravity affects bullets and ships.
	 Neat graphical effect required!

*** Big head mode
	 Easier to shoot at, harder to slip between planets but kills on
	 contact.

*** Paintball mode
	 Spray other ships with your colors! Rating 2 and up.

*** Mirror image
	 Copy of the ship that mirror the player, but turn in opposite
	 directions.  Fires phony bullets, disappear when colliding
	 something (different explosion visual).

*** Poisoned mushroom
	 Shrink or enlarge the ship's size.

** Bonuses tweaks
*** Visual clue for number of mines in bonus
*** Charging shield push power
	 - Reuse firing key to charge a shield and send push gravity force
** Gameplay tweaks
*** Constrain maximum ship / bullet velocity
	 The gravity field of shields sometimes sends ships flying to the
	 other side of the map.  But, we need this field to be strong
	 enough to repel nearby ships.
*** Use down arrow
	 - Slow down the ship with additional little engines
	 - Or quick half-turn
** Environment
*** Asteroids
		Blob-like asteroids slowly drifting across the map.
		Breaks into smaller asteroids when hit.

*** Base
		Usable as a spawn area when playing with teams. Could take the
    form of a big planet riddled with tunnels or a more mechanical
    mothership.

		Could be protected with sentries targetting invasive enemy players
    (this game lacks laser!). At the start of the round, bases are
    unprotected and players must earn sentries. We could use bonuses
    as a ressource : players bring them to a dedicated drop zone
    inside the base to progressively improve the base defense.

** Other game modes
*** Team deathmatch

*** King of the hill
    Highlight one area on the map, every second alive in the area
    gives one point. Change area after some time.

*** Courrier / Team courrier
    Pick item at A, bring at B, score. Capture the flag but without
    bases or carefully designed levels.

*** The man with the golden ship
    First player to grab the golden bonus is granted unique powers,
    others have to shoot him down to grab the bonus and rack up the
    kills.

*** Triple team
		Three teams, each one having a prey team and a hunter team.
		The team which kills the most preys wins.
		A ship can only be killed by a member of its hunter team.

*** Death race
	 All ships spawn at the start line, first to finish wins.
	 The map is tailored for the race, with planets on either side (or
	 asteroids fields), and some obstacles on it.
	 Bullets are disabled, as are ship collisions (maybe bump into
	 obstacles and ships).
	 Boosts are mandatory.

* Graphics
** Leave some ephemeral traces of fight on planets.
   Ships and bullets splatters their colors. Ã€ la paintball.

* Core
** Use an event model where needed.
   Ships could emit 'fire', 'death', 'explosion' events, bonus
   can register them and act safely upon it instead of relying on
   polling the ship state.

   Bonus too could benefit by emitting the 'effect wears off' event
   catched by ships instead of managing the bonusTimeouts explicitly.

   While this is a nice pattern, we need to make sure calling
   listeners is synchronous. If that must be done, use our own
   synchronous EventEmitter.

** Expire deserted games
** Prevent objects from spawning onto each other
** Rework client drawing.
   Find out why Core2 with puny graphic chipset can handle the client fullscreen
   when beefier hardware can't.

** Send full game update to reconnecting / out of sync clients.
   Client should clean everything and start anew from this update.
** Use composition instead of inheritance where it makes sense
** Filter updates sent to clients
	Don't send update position for an invisible ship.
